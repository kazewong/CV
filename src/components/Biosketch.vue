              I work on a wide range of topics revolving around building production-grade software for real-life problems to take on challenges that are progress-limiting.
              The topics I work on include but not limited to data-driven astrophysics, bayesian inference, high performance machine learning-enhanced simulations, robust machine learning, digital twins, medical imaging, and large-scale deep learning.
              I deeply care about code performance, usability, and robustness. I am also a strong advocate for open-source software and reproducible research.
