#set strong(delta: 500)

I work on a wide range of topics revolving around building *production-grade machine learning enhanced software for real-life problems* to take on challenges that are progress-limiting. The topics I work on include but are not limited to data-driven astrophysics, bayesian inference, high performance machine learning-enhanced simulations, robust machine learning, digital twins, medical imaging, and large-scale deep learning. I deeply care about *code performance, usability, and robustness*. I am also a strong advocate for *open-source software* and reproducible research.
